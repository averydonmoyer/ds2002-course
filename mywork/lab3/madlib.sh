echo "Once upon a time there was a dog with $ADJ1 fur. The dog's favorite toy 
was a(n) $NOUN1, and he played with it every day. Over time the toy became $ADJ2.
The dog's owner bought a new toy from his friend $NAME1. The dog loved this toy 
so much that the owner went back the next day and bought $NUM1 more, but these 
toy's quickly became $ADJ3 because of all the time the dog spent dragging them 
through the mud and backyard stream. He played with the toys so $ADV1, they 
didn't last long, and when the dog's owner saw what he'd done to the toys, he $VERB1 
and $VERB2. But in the end, the owner realized that the dog only played so hard 
becuase he loved the toys, and they both were happy."
